Tuples:
 - Tuples are an ordered sequence of data
 - Tuples are immutable as strings
 - Tuples are created using elements seperated by commas within parenthesis
 - You CAN concatenate or add tuples together even though they are immutable data types.
 - Tuples CAN be sliced even though they are immutable data types.
